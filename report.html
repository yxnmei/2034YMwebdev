    <h1>Wong Yan Mei's Report</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            What is the essential story being told by your portfolio site? Describe the version of you that it is about.
            What is the audience you are addressing? What type of structure did you choose to implement?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The essential story conveyed by my portfolio is the vision of my future self, 10 years from now. In that time, I see myself as an accomplished freelance designer and entrepreneur, leveraging my expertise to build custom digital solutions for businesses. Additionally, I aspire to be a passionate advocate and mentor for women and girls in STEM, particularly in technology-related fields.

            After completing my university education, I envision beginning my career in the corporate world, working in web development for a leading company. This foundational experience will span about five years, where I will hone my skills and broaden my industry knowledge. Following this, I plan to transition into freelancing, establishing my own design and development business, while also dedicating significant time to mentoring.
            
            My audience includes:
            
            Businesses and individuals seeking custom web development solutions that are innovative, user-centric, and designed to meet specific needs.
            Schools and corporate workplaces interested in fostering diversity in tech by providing opportunities for women and girls to develop their technical skills through mentoring programs.
            The structure of my portfolio reflects these two key roles: my technical expertise and my commitment to mentorship. It highlights my projects, skills, and experiences, while also emphasizing my future vision as a mentor for the next generation of women in tech.</p>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>

            State 3 relevant professional portfolio sites (not advice articles or templates) that have inspired you when creating your website. Say what you have learned from them.
            Resources: What resources did you use in your work? List any sources of information, libraries, plugins, code or tools (you should also indicate inclusions from other sources within your code using comments).

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sumit-vekariya.surge.sh/home" target="_blank">Sumit Vekariya's Portfolio</a></li>
            <p>Sumit’s portfolio inspired me with its minimalist design and strong focus on visual storytelling. 
                I learned the importance of letting my work speak for itself through clean and uncluttered design elements.
            </p>
            <li><a href="https://rubenkuipers.design/" target="_blank">Ruben Kuipers' Portfolio</a></li>
            <p>Ruben’s site stood out for its use of bold typography and interactive elements. From his portfolio, I learned how to integrate subtle animations and transitions to keep users engaged without overwhelming them.</p>
            
            <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">Codewars</a></li>
            <p>I really liked the UI style of Codewars' website and took inspiration from its clean, functional layout when creating my designs. The use of spacing and minimal color made the content easier to digest.</p>
